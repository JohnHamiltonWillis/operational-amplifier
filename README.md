Operational Amplifier
=====================
This project was developed with Electric VLSI and the results of it are available for viewing in a GDSII file or PNG. The analog integrated circuit is a three stage op-amp designed for output buffers, stability, gain and phase margin, biasing, and op amp compensation. The project features a biasing stage for all the different sized transistors, a differential amplifier for inputs, a push-pull amplifier to improve the output, and a compensation network to improve stability.
