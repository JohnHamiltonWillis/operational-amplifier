Operational Amplifier
=====================
This project was developed with Electric VLSI and the results of it are available for viewing in a GDSII file or PNG. The analog integrated circuit is a three stage op-amp designed for output buffers, stability, gain and phase margin, biasing, and op amp compensation.
